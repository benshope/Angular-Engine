## App Engine CMS (NOT USABLE)

DEMO: http://angular-engine.appspot.com
This project is meant to rapidly take users from nothing to a functioning website.  Right now it is just a nice boilerplate with Angular and Bootstrap.

## Roadmap
There are a lot of frameworks and boilerplates that have merit.  The feature that helps this one stand out from the crowd is it's split-screen front-end code editor.  That means changes to the the HTML and CSS appear instantly as they are typed in the browser.  This provides constant feedback while editing the site.  It is an amazing way to work.

## Technologies
+ [Google App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/) Back-End Web Server
+ [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) Front-End Javascript Framework
